# Birdwatch

A Birdwatching application made with React native and Expo.

To run this application you will need Node.js and either Android-studio or Xcode if you're on MAC and plan to use IOs.

You will also need Expo client that can be installed with following command:

# Install the command line tools
npm install --global expo-cli

# Create a new project
expo init my-project

after the client has stopped just copy the project on top of the folder and run

npm install

Then you can run the application on either your phone or the emulator by typing

npm start

# About application
The application is very simple, there's just the one screen where you can see the list of items and the add observation button.
By clicking the list items you will open a more detailed view of the sighting.
Adding pictures and saving the list are still under construction.
